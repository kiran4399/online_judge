Hello everybody,
      I hope today's lab exam is easy. I just want you guys to score well in atleast C-Programming. For those to whom I told that today's lab-exam will be difficult are in one way lucky and in other way unlucky. lucky because they will prepare hard and unlucky because they will have to spend a night (i.e. Yesterday's night with lots of bad anticipation). But anyway the only thing I want you guys to do is work hard, prepare everything and score. This exam is nothing but:

      void pecular_kiran's_exam(string type_of_students, int number){

          while(as_long_as_the_students_are_interested){ 

              if(students_are_not_interested)
                  Break;
              //who cares for them anyway !!!

              else if(number > 50 && type_of_students =='LAZY')
                  Give_a_damn_tough_paper();
              //Make them work hard !!

              else if(number > 10 && type_of_students =='HARDWORKING')
                  Give_a_paper_which_will_benifit_them();
              //Nice people... I am impressed !!!

              else 
                  leave_them_alone();
              //LOL !!!
          }

          if(you_read_above_mentioned_stuff_as_it_will_come_for_exam)
              Fool!!! you have wasted lot of time !! code fast !!
          else
              Oh Sweatheart !!! you understood the trick behind this !!!
      }
